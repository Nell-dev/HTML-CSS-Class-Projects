      <p>Career wise, I am currently pursuing a degree as a software developer. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of it and the ever-evolving world of technology. I find excitement in bringing ideas to life through software and continuous learning aspect.</p>
      <p>Outside of the digital world, I enjoy an active lifestyle. I have an unhealthy addiction to  junk food which is why I bake treats and sharing them with friends and family.  I am most happiest in spring and summer because it is conducive to the outdoor activities that I most enjoy being surrounded by nature. My favorite activities being camping, swimming, and biking.</p>
